## Project Dashboard
For project Dashboard, I created multiple tables which involved several processing stages, including preprocessing, cleaning, analyzing and visualization data. 

## Project Analysis
For project Analysis, I use relationship functions inside DAX, specifically CROSSFILTER and CALCULATE functions to name a few, then created slicer and use combo chart to show the top 10 skill pay for data science careers and related professions.
